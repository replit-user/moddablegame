## **Section 5: Warranties**

The Software is provided **as-is**. After download, any damage or issues are your responsibility.

-   No warranties are issued.
    
-   If the Software remains hosted on GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab, it may be redownloaded at no additional cost.



The term “malicious” is ambiguous. For this license, Software is considered malicious if it meets any one of the following criteria, regardless of intent:

1. It actively tries to harm, delete, or modify data, or compromise data integrity.
2. It actively tries to modify its own code or the code of other programs on disk.
3. It compromises system or application security.
4. It is flagged by default antivirus tools in Windows, Ubuntu Linux, or Google Drive.
5. Any action is taken without the user’s knowledge or permission.

Only one of these points needs to be met for the Software to be considered malicious.

Examples of malicious software include, but are not limited to:
- Wannacry ransomware
- An assembly program intended to be loaded at a specific memory address but loaded elsewhere, attempting to access another program’s memory
- An MP3 file edited to execute arbitrary code
- A Python script that deletes all files in a directory
